    "In this course, you are not required to become proficient in writing R scripts for Big Biomedical Data Analytics. The assignments will be based on each module's template, and replacing some parts of them with new data and parameters so that you will get new results and interpret them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding all the coding details in R will depend on your bakcground knowledge in programming concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore if you do not understand all the coding details in R, try to run the code and understand mostly: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) what information do I have to provide to this script to make it work ?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) how to execute this script (it will always be: run the cell containing the script Cell --> Run cells, or click on SHIFT + ENTER at the same time, or simply click on the right arrow icon) ?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) what results do I get ?\n",
    "\n",
    "4) how to interpret the results ?\n",

    "In this notebook, you are going to practice analyzing files containing copy number variations. Since for a known population, cBioPortal cna be used for that purpose, we are going to get reults at the patient level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are continuing to work on a breast cancer dataset downloaded from Firehose (https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/). The dataset used is \"BRCA.snp__genome_wide_snp_6__broad_mit_edu__Level_3__segmented_scna_minus_germline_cnv_hg19__seg.seg.txt\". This is a complete dataset of copy number alterations from the whole geneome compared with a normal genome. \n",

    "This dataset has 6 columns:\n",

    "         Sample                    Chromosome     Start       End        Num_Probes  Segment_Mean\n",

    "\n",
    "'Sample' represents the patient ID (there are some normals too as we saw previously).\n",
    "'Chromosome' represents the chromosome number.\n",
    "'Start' represents the start position of the segmented window.\n",
    "'End' represents the end position of the segmented window.\n",
    "'Num_Probes' represents the number of probes in the segmented window.\n",
    "'Segment_Mean' represents the mean copy numner estimate of this particular segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "When 'Segment_Mean' is greater than 0, there is amplification, and when it is less than 0, there is deletion. However slight variations do not count much, as we saw. Often cut-off values of +0.2 and -0.2 are chosen to determine whether there is amplificaiton or deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will find whether a particular patient has copy number alterations, and how much.\n",
